Sinatra/ActiveRecord/sqlite3 App: Simple Steps
"Sinatra is a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort"

"Sinatra ActiveRecord Extension extends Sinatra with extension methods and Rake tasks for dealing with an SQL database using the ActiveRecord ORM."

"Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database."

Part One: Setting Up

1.) Create project directory

mkdir building_sinatra_blog_app
2.) Add a Gemfile (no file extension) that includes the gems needed for your application. This file is used by the Bundler gem.

#Gemfile
source "http://rubygems.org"

gem "activerecord"
gem "sinatra-activerecord"
gem "rake"
gem "sqlite3"
3.) Install the gems. This generates the Gemfile.lock file.

bundle install
4.) Create the main application file (app.rb) and require in the gems that will be used in this file and set/name the database. Notice the syntax of the second argument of the set method.

# app.rb
require "sinatra"
require "sinatra/activerecord"

set :database, "sqlite3:myblogdb.sqlite3"
5.) Create a Rakefile (no file extension). This file locates and loads tasks that can be run from the command line.

#Rakefile

require "./app"
require "sinatra/activerecord/rake"
6.) Use command line rake task to create the database

rake db:create
Part One Recap

At this point, we have installed the necessary gems for Rake, ActiveRecord and sqlite3, created the main application file, set the database, and created a Rakefile which has allowed us to use a command line rake task to create the database.

The app we want to build is a basic blog that allows a user to add a post with a title and a body. We can create a database table called posts that has three columns: a string column called title, a text column called body, and a timestamps column (which gives us two automatic datetime columns called created_at and updated_at). We'll model the posts with an Active Record model class called Post.

Part Two: Model

We will do two things in this step: add a posts table to the empty database and create a class called Post (an Active Record model), mapped to the posts table. This will allow us to make queries on the posts table using Active Record methods. Notice the class "Post" is singular and capitalized, while the database "posts" table is plural and lowercase.

ex.

@post = Post.find(2)

1.) Use command line rake task to create a migration with the name parameter set to create_posts. You can get a list of the rake tasks by typing the rake command with a -T flag.

$ bundle exec rake -T
rake db:create              # Creates the database from DATABASE_URL or con...
rake db:create_migration    # Create a migration (parameters: NAME, VERSION)
rake db:drop                # Drops the database from DATABASE_URL or confi...
rake db:fixtures:load       # Load fixtures into the current environment's ...
rake db:migrate             # Migrate the database (options: VERSION=x, VER...
rake db:migrate:status      # Display status of migrations
rake db:rollback            # Rolls the schema back to the previous version...
rake db:schema:cache:clear  # Clear a db/schema_cache.dump file
rake db:schema:cache:dump   # Create a db/schema_cache.dump file
rake db:schema:dump         # Create a db/schema.rb file that is portable a...
rake db:schema:load         # Load a schema.rb file into the database
rake db:seed                # Load the seed data from db/seeds.rb
rake db:setup               # Create the database, load the schema, and ini...
rake db:structure:dump      # Dump the database structure to db/structure.sql
rake db:structure:load      # Recreate the databases from the structure.sql...
rake db:version             # Retrieves the current schema version number
$ rake db:create_migration NAME=create_posts
The name of the migration file is the name passed in as NAME via the db:create_migration rake command and is preceded by a timestamp. The migration file is a ruby script. The file itself is found in the newly created (because this was the first migration) db directory.

2.) To the change method, add a block that creates a posts table with the desired columns.

class CreatePostsTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :posts do |t|
        t.string :title
        t.text :body
        t.timestamps null: false
    end
  end
end
This change method will get called when the migration is run.

3.) Use the command line rake task to run the migration.

$ rake db:migrate
Because this is our first migration, the db/schema.rb file is generated. This file should not be touched. This file represents the up to date structure of your database and is maintained by Active Record. You can read more about Active Record migrations here.

4.) Add a models.rb file to the project folder and require this file into the main application file, app.rb. In the models.rb file, create the Post class (model) that inherits from Active Record.

#app.rb 
#place after require "sinatra/activerecord"  
require "./models.rb"
#models.rb
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
end
Part Two Recap

At this point, we have set up the app, the database, added a posts table and a Post model. Our posts table has 4 columns for title, body, created_at, and updated_at. We do not yet have any posts or a way for a user to add posts.

Part Three: CRUD it up

We do not need posts in our table to start building out our app. However, let's take a break to explore Active Record. If we require in the models.rb file, which contains our Post model, we can make queries to the database using Active Record methods.

1.) Start up irb and require the main app file, app.rb.

$ irb
> require './app'

2.) READ
Use the .all method to return a collection of all records. 

irb
```bash
> Post.all
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation []>
3.) CREATE Use the .create method to create and save a new record.

irb

> Post.create(title: "Hello World!", body: "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy") 
=> #<Post id: 1, title: "Hello World!", body: "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy", created_at: "2015-12-21 01:56:01", updated_at: "2015-12-21 01:56:01">
Or, use the .new and .save method

irb

post = Post.new
post.title = "HTML-909"
post.body = "Check out this TR-909 throwback http://html909.com/"
post.save
